In my specific use case, I found that temperature, top_p and top_k played a major role in audio generated.\nWhat are those things though ?\nTemperature - helps control the randomness / creativity of the model. Basically you adjust the probabilities to force randomness or determinism. During training the temperature is 1. Mathematically, when the probability of next token is being calculated the model will divide that by your temperature value. "}]
