      <description>My setup worked twice today but I did not trade it. I think I chickened out because I was not sure for some reason idk why but yes I did not follow my rules today. In the later second half, out of fomo I tried to ride the wave but got caught right on the reversal and had to book a big loss. My few days win streak ended just because of my immaturity and carelessness.</description>

      <description>The market has been very volatile recently. I was able to ride the uptrend 3 times but due to the volatile nature of market (vix was around 21) I kept my ride short. But I was able to get the momentum in prices. The day ended in decent profit. Although I could have left a few positions running since the uptrend was very strong but considering the continuous red candles in BNF I told myself to be satisfied in short runs.</description>

      <description>Controlling temp, top_p and top_k # So I have been working on a TTS model and for the last few days I am playing with few hyperparameters. In my specific use case, I found that temperature, top_p and top_k played a major role in audio generated.&#xA;temperature # helps control the randomness / creativity of the model. Basically you adjust the probabilities to force randomness or determinism. During training the temperature is 1.</description>

      <description>Hessian Matrix # A Hessian matrix is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function. It describes the local curvature of a function. For a function f(x, y, &amp;hellip;, z) of several variables, the Hessian matrix H is defined as:&#xA;\[\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} &amp;amp; \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} &amp;amp; \cdots &amp;amp; \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial z} \\ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x} &amp;amp; \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} &amp;amp; \cdots &amp;amp; \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial z} \\ \vdots &amp;amp; \vdots &amp;amp; \ddots &amp;amp; \vdots \\ \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z \partial x} &amp;amp; \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z \partial y} &amp;amp; \cdots &amp;amp; \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial z^2} \end{bmatrix}\] The above Hessian is of the the function ùëì:ùëÖ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤‚ÜíùëÖ where all second order partial derivatives of ùëì exist and are continuous throughout its domain &amp;amp; the function is $$f(x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n)$$</description>
