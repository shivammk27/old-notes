In the later second half, out of fomo I tried to ride the wave but got caught right on the reversal and had to book a big loss. My few days win streak ended just because of my immaturity and carelessness. A little disappointed but tomorrow we will do better.\nWell it is roughly 25 mins later after I wrote the above part and turns out I would have made good profit if I could have held it for longer.

You have to really desperately want it (the wealth, the game and the gain)\n2. Status is a hierarchical game # In order for you to be at place 1 someone has to go down. It is zero sum. Status is a better predictor of survival than wealth. Politics, Game, etc are all status based. Avoid these games (focus on creating wealth)\n3.

Basically you adjust the probabilities to force randomness or determinism. During training the temperature is 1.

Sort them, organise them so you can very quickly recall what do you want to talk about\n5. Find good frameworks to use # How to find frameworks ?\nTake some situation/project/idea/whatever and start breaking it down into smaller and simpler components. Then see what makes sense and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t. Try to reason why something is there. Once you are able to do this you can basically learn any framework Make your own framework.
