My setup worked twice today but I did not trade it.
I think I chickened out because I was not sure for some reason idk why but yes I did not follow my rules today. \
In the later second half, out of fomo I tried to ride the wave but got caught right on the reversal and had to book a big loss. My few days win streak ended just because of my immaturity and carelessness. \
A little disappointed but tomorrow we will do better.

Well it is roughly 25 mins later after I wrote the above part and turns out I would have made good profit if I could have held it for longer. I know BNF moves fast but tbh I did not anticipate this to happen.
