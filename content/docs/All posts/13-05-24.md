The market has been very volatile recently. I was able to ride the uptrend 3 times but due to the volatile nature of market (vix was around 21) I kept my ride short. But I was able to get the momentum in prices. \
The day ended in decent profit. \
Although I could have left a few positions running since the uptrend was very strong but considering the continuous red candles in BNF I told myself to be satisfied in short runs.
