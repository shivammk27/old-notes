### 5. Find good frameworks to use

How to find frameworks ?

- Take some situation/project/idea/whatever and start breaking it down into smaller and simpler components. Then see what makes sense and what doesn't. Try to reason why something is there. Once you are able to do this you can basically learn any framework
- Make your own framework. Once your brain is used to system thinking and framework thinking making new and custom models for your own needs becomes easier and much helpful
  Example - ethos, pathos,logos -> credibility, emotions and logic
